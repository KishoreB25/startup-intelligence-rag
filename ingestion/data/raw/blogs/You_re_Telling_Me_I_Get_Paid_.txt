This hypothetical keeps circulating on social media like some kind of impossible challenge. A month in a cabin with food, water, and firewood but no internet, phone, or TV. The reward: $100,000.
I need everyone to understand something. I would do this for free. You're offering to pay me?
I've spent two decades in tech. I've answered "quick questions" at 11pm. I've debugged production issues on Christmas morning. I've felt my soul leave my body during the fourth video call of the day where someone shares their screen to show me an email they could have just forwarded. My nervous system has been marinated in Teams notifications for so long that I twitch when I hear any sound vaguely resembling a ping.
A month of enforced silence sounds less like a challenge and more like a prescription.
The comments on these posts always fascinate me. "I could never do it." "I'd go crazy." And I think... would you? Or have we just forgotten what our brains feel like without the constant dopamine drip of notifications? I'm genuinely not sure I remember what boredom feels like. Real boredom. The kind that eventually transforms into creativity or rest or just staring at trees like some kind of functioning mammal.
So yes. I would absolutely do this. I'd walk into that cabin like I was checking into a spa.
The only real question is whether they'd have to drag me out at the end.
